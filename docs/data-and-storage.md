# Data and Storage Boundary

## MVP Data Contract

| Data | Source | Processing | Persistence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Selected photo | Authorized JPEG or PNG uploaded to the local Streamlit session | Content validation, then in-memory decode, local pose detection, and overlay rendering | None by the application |
| Pose landmarks | Local MediaPipe result for the current image | In-memory validation and angle calculation | None |
| Angle and feedback | Pure Python demonstration rule | Visible in the current browser session | None |
| Versioned demo assets | Ten Creative Commons reference photos and their derived Streamlit screenshots | Regression input and documented local-browser evidence | Tracked only in `docs/demo-assets/` with an attribution manifest |
| PoseLandmarker model | Official model download | Local CPU inference | Ignored local dependency; not user data |

## Rules

- The MVP has no database, account, analytics pipeline, upload bucket, app-managed cache, result history, or public deployment.
- The app must not deliberately write uploaded photos, landmark coordinates, annotated images, or results to disk, logs, test fixtures, screenshots, temporary folders, or Git.
- Browser and Streamlit session memory may hold the current uploaded bytes and result only as needed to display the current analysis. Closing or refreshing the session is not a persistence feature.
- The application rejects non-JPEG/PNG content, files above 10 MB, and images above 20 megapixels before RGB conversion. Those limits reduce accidental or hostile resource exhaustion; they do not create a storage record.
- `uploads/`, `data/private/`, and `models/` remain ignored defensively. They are not approved storage locations for user data.
- The only approved tracked photo exception is `docs/demo-assets/`: its ten source photos and ten derived screenshots are public documentation assets, not runtime storage. Preserve the source links, author credits, and applicable Creative Commons terms in its manifest.
- Do not move any other test photos, user uploads, annotated examples, or model binaries into tracked paths.
- A feature that saves, shares, uploads, synchronizes, or publicly serves a photo requires new consent, retention, deletion, access-control, and backup design.

## Asset Review

The versioned asset set is catalogued in [demo-assets/README.md](demo-assets/README.md).
Before using any additional demo image, record ownership, subject consent,
competition permission, and whether public repository or video use is allowed.
